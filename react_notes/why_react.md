react is better than vanilla js because vanilla js quickly gets complicated for large projects.

react is a one page application because it is one page updating itself in the browser based
on user interaction. Classic application have the html/css/js rendered on the server-side then sent
to the client.

react is basically a bunch of components painted on the screen.

npx create-react-app@5 app-name will create a react app of version 5.
